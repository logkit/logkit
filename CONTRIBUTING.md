# Contributing to LogKit

The LogKit Project welcomes contributions from the community! Please review this document to understand how to participate in the project.

## Security Issues

Please do **not** file public issues for security concerns. Instead, please email your report privately to <security@logkit.info>. This will allow us to fix the issue and release an update before exposing the issue. Once an update has been released, we will work with you to publish the issue and get the credit you deserve.

## Other Contributions

We welcome pull requests, issues, and discussion from the community. Please be detailed!

### Issues

Before creating a new issue, please have a search through the issue tracker to be sure it doesn't already exist. If it does, give the issue a +1, or add a comment with any additional detail that could help. This will assist in prioritizing issues, and fixing them as quickly as possible.

### Pull Requests

Please adhere to the following style guidelines when contributing code to LogKit:

  - Lines should generally be limited to 120 characters in length, unless splitting a line negatively affects readability.
  - Use explicit `self` in all cases, as it improves code readability.
  - Follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines][API_Guidelines].
  - Include Quick Help documentation for any new objects/methods/functions. See the [Xcode Markup docs][xcode_markup] for details.
